    <h2>SEO Techniques</h2>
      <h4>SEO Technique 1 - Indexing</h4>
        <p>SEO indexing is when a search engine scans through web pages for keywords relating to the users search (Lumar, 2024). The websites with the most accuracy are then showed first. 
          This also allows for quick response time to a users search. Google uses something called "inverted index" (Lumar). Inverted index is when a database is used to reduce keywords in a search to their individual meanings. 
          Indexing is a very good processes because I beleive it gives the user the most accurate search results.</p>
      <h4>SEO Technique 2 - White hat</h4>
       <p>White hat SEO is the technique of optimizing webpages to improve search rankings while also follow search engine guidelines (Taheer, 2024).
        White hat SEO allows for webpages to be more relevant to users searches. White hat allows for search results to be more informative and useful
        compared to a just trying to gain site traffic. I like White hat SEO because it allows for the benefits for SEO to still be gained 
        while also allowing for equal relevancy for other websites. It also gives users accurate and useful results.
       </p>
      <h4>SEO Technique 3 - Cross linking</h4>
        <p>Cross linking SEO is the technique of linking other web pages to your own webpage with the goal of linking relevant works or content to a users search (Grapevinemktg, 2015).
          This is done to keep users on the website for as long as possible. This is achieved with linking pages because it builds the overall
          authority of your website allowing for easier access to content (Grapevinemktg). I like this technique because it gives the user a easier way
          to research obstract content with the use of one search query.

    <h2>SMO Techniques</h2>
      <h4>SMO Technique 1 - Intergrate Social Media into Website</h4>
        <p>Intergrating social media into a website will boost the SMO rankings in any aspect (Jof, 2023). Intergrating can have several meanings but im going to focus
          on the implentation of social media buttons. Intergrating social media buttons to a website is a simple
          way of interlinking them together. This can be as simple as adding share or interactive buttons that allow the user to intercate with your social media page.
          I think this a great technique because it is a simple and easy way to improve a websites SMO ranking.
        </p>
      <h4>SMO Technique 2 - Similar Social Media Tags </h4>
        <p>When searching for a company/person a search query will be done using the names of the relevant search. It is 
          important to use similar names for all social platforms to allow for one search result to bring back all the relevant pages (Lockard, 2013).
          This can also be done to a website by using similar keywords and names as social media tags to bring back 
          your website during a query.
        </p>
      <h4>SMO Technique 3 - Encourage Sharing</h4>
        <p>Sharing on social media is one of the best ways to grow your ranking. Encouraging
          others to share your content will help grow your website. This can improve your website by 
          including keywords and similar social tags.
